# Youtube Viewer

This utility is meant to work as a simple Youtube play queue for myself. It can fetch from RSS feeds of subscribers, and show a fzf interface for the actual playing.

This is not intended for other people to use, and there'll be minimal support for such (if it works on my machine that's good enough). You are of course welcome to read the source and figure out how it works, and change it to your likings.
